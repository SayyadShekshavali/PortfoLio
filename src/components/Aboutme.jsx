            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA),
            where I am building a strong foundation in programming,
            problem-solving, and both frontend and backend technologies to shape
            a successful career in the tech industry. I have completed a
            comprehensive MERN stack course on Udemy, gaining hands-on
            experience with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Currently,
            Iâ€™m applying this knowledge by working on real-world projects to
            deepen my practical understanding.

            In addition, I am actively learning Data Structures and Algorithms
            (DSA) using Java to strengthen my core problem-solving skills. I
            have solved over 160+ LeetCode problems as part of various LeetCode
            batches, which has further enhanced my analytical and coding
            abilities. I am passionate about turning innovative ideas into
            impactful applications through technology.
